# Data Insight Suggestions:

1. Overall best/ worst value for money calculation -> total cost (eg: £50,000) divided by average starting Salary (or data over 1/ 2/ 5/ 10 years salary metrics) to give ROI and 'break-even' point of students' investment in their education at that Uni - could be broken down further over each individual course.
Costs should include: full degree tuition fees + living cost (housing/ rent/ utilities) over course
2. Mine/ present data on students satisfaction levels: perceived value for money. Support from lecturers. Community societies/ support study groups
3. Mine/ present data on access to libraries/ computers/ resources
4. Unis with best support networks on mindfulness/ meditation and mental wellbeing 
5. Lecturer/ student metrics - X students per lecturer how that effects not just performance, also wellbieng/ grades/ entry level to Uni/ first year salaries
6. Data on required entry Grades, versus actual acheived (and still accepted) entry grades last 5 yrs - if they are accepting lower grades than they require, Uni is undersubscribed - not as popular a choice. Also indication to student of Uni flexibility (prior to sitting A-Level exams - may affect Uni 1st/ 2nd choices)
7. Best Uni's for Social activities / sports groups
8. Most/ least expensive places to study -> visualize on map/ filter by {least/ most}
9. % of Uni leavers finding employment within next 12m
10. Table presenting data on Unis most closely tracking trends in business across sectors and actively steering courses (eg software development courses on JS/ TypeScript) so assured relevant to industry
11. Diversity helps businesses adapt, which Uni’s excel at promoting confidence and empowering students from diverse cultures (eg. US Howard University)
12. Study metrics of what best (& worst) unis are doing differently now, or what they were doing differently from the 'average' 1-5yrs ago to generate indicators for future performance. Present to students and sell to Unis to inform decisions & either expand in that direction/ or head off/ improve performance before they continue too far down a known (from other Uni metrics) trajectory. (Eg, lecturer numbers consistently falling. Tuition fees increasing more than services. Stufent accomodation/ housing reports of poor/ dilapidated services, if unresolved may lead to..)
13. Part time/ or full time post-grad employment opportunities in the area
14. Investment initiatives including upcoming Government regeneration schemes in the area, metrics on how that affects (benefits) students and Uni rankings/ student satisfaction levels
